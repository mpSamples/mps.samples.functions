This is another really simple sample. It's main goal is to get working
a basic example very fast.

This sample shows:
* Use of Expressions in the DSL
* Generation of Java Code
* Use of styles in inspector (see Function concept editor, cell Iterations
  in Inspector there is a Style with background-color and text-foreground-color)

You can create a project with your favourite IDE and point the source directory
to the solutions output directory.
